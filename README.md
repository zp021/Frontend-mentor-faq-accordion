## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use the details and summary tag for things like frequently asked questions that can be toggled with answers.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<details class="faq">
  <summary class="question">What is the maximum file upload size?</summary>
  <p class="answer">
    No more than 2GB. All files in your account must fit your allotted storage
    space.
  </p>
</details>
```

### Continued development

I wasn't sure about the javascrip part of this challenge, so I'll have to go back and double check that.

### Useful resources

- [Details tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_details.asp) - This helped me with the faqs section.
